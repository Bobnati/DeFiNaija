    Well, chief among them is accessibility.
</p>

   <p> You see, despite the fact that banking has been around for thousand of years,
    a lot of the world population (ABOUT 2 BILLION people!!) remain unbanked.

<br>
i.e they have no bank accounts whatsoever! Imagine still keeping all your stash under your pillow in 2024..lol</p>
    
    <p>In Nigeria, the situation isn't too different.
    A lot of Nigerians are still unbanked.

    ">study</a> claims only about 36.5% of Nigerians are financially included a.k.a use the banking system.
    translating to over 100 million people.

    A lot of Nigerian towns and villages don't even have banks at all.
    </p>
    

    <p>
        This is where De-Fi comes in. Apparently, there is a reason a lot of reasons why traditional banking cannot serve
        everyone. Infrastructual challenges (they have to build the physical bank buildings in the village or rural area, power those buildings, 
        secure it, staff it e.t.c, right?), that is not so easy in some locations and significantly drive up cost of operations
        for the bank. So its just not worth it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, banks are heavily regulated.
        Know Your Customer regulations leads to banks having to ask for all sort of details before they open an
        account for you, name of your mom, your NIN, BVN, fingerprints, your gf, your bf...lol and all
        that kind of stressful stuff.

           Then there's Defi.
           
           Where all you need to get started is a smart device and an internet connection!

           Yeah, that is truly all there is!
           
           De-Fi removes A LOT (and trust me, there are a lot!) of the hassles with the financial systems and 
           simplifies things.  

           You don't need an NIN to use stablecoins like USDT or USDC, you don't need fingerprints to open a DeFi
           account. You don't need NEPA bills as well to withdraw your money from your De-Fi wallet. You don't need 
           to put your Granpa's house on the line to get a loan.
           </p>

           <p>
            <br>
           
        Well, that is why we love this technology, it has the potential to simplify our lives, 
        and build a more equitable and accessible financial system
        by eliminating barriers that prevent certain individuals and communities from accessing traditional 
        financial systems.
