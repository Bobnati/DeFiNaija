    <p>So, ethereum just dropped its latest roadmap last week, and it's got more parts than 
        a Nollywood blockbuster.

    Now, if you're rolling with an average IQ like me (and proudly so),
     your first look at the roadmap might have you scratching your head like,
      "Wetin be this?"

     But fear not, my friends, you are on DeFi naija
      where we make crypto easy without ever making you feel dumber.
    </p>

   <p>  So, here's the Ethereum Roadmap for Dummies:
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Merge:</strong> Mission = shift to a decentralized proof-of-stake vibe. 
Basically, Ethereum goes green, becomes deflationary,
 and throws in a sustainable staking yield. (FYI, this went down in Sept. 2022).
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Surge:</strong> Mission = Increase network speed to over 100,000TPS.
Think of this as MTN moving from 4G to 5G...
 This turbocharges Layer 2s, making them faster, cheaper, 
 and unlocking some fancy use cases. 
 (A lot of projects are basically holding their breath for this upgrade to go live on L2s).
</p>

<p>
<strong>
The Scourge:</strong> Mission = tackle centralisation worries in the Ethereum PoS design, 
especially around MEV and liquid staking. 
L2s and liquid staking have been the culprits and have been accused of make Ethereum less decentralised.
<blockquote>
In crypto less decentralised = bad.
more decentralised = good
</blockquote>
 The Scourge is going to make Ethereum more decentralised.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Verge:</strong> Mission = make verifying blocks as breezy as Oniru beach 
(i.e., download data, do a few simple calculations, verify, and boom, you're done). 
This leads to smoother data flow and node structures which makes the network faster and efficient.
</p>


<p>
<strong>The Purge:</strong> Mission = cleans up bugs and other redundant components on the network.
 This cleanse makes the network more efficient overall.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Splurge:</strong> Mission = fix anything else that needs fixing.
 Think of it as the last dance. 
 Vitalik (founder of ethereum) calls it "the fun stuff" because all the heavy work would have been done at this stage.
</p>

<p>
Sure, this roadmap might take a Nigerian party's worth of years to wrap up,
 but it's still pretty cool to peep into Ethereum's past, present, and future, 
 which has been getting some dirty looks lately. (Solana boys-- looking at yall)
